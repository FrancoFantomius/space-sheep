## Now working on
- The movement
  - the player moves(⬅️) -> (the map is divided in chuncks) the user cache the chuncks opposite, deletes the chuncks too far from the spaceship, request new chunks to cache

## Mechanics to be implemented
- Multiplayer
  - spaceships collision
  - trades
- Interface
  - Registration / Login
  - Main menu
  - Loading
  - In-game status (health, damage, energy, shields)
  - Settings
    - Chuncks to be cached (?)
- Tutorial

## New ideas
(If they are marked, they will be included)
- [ ] Create a layer between the spaceship and the map (more immersivity)
- [ ] More blocks for the spaceships (doors, controlls, ...)
- [ ] Robots (can move, have roles, ...)
- [ ] Missions (on planets, space-stations, action, puzzles, ...)
- [ ] Stars / Black-holes (the spaceship can interact with/be damaged)
- [ ] Special spaceships (???)
- [ ] Chat(???)

## Outside of the game
Things to do for the game but not in the game:
- Site (presentation of the game, documentation for new devs)
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- Social-profiles (or maybe not)
